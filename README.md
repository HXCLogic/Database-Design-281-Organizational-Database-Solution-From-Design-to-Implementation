# Organizational-Database-Solution-From-Design-to-Implementation
This project guideline outlines the steps to develop a relational database for a small to medium-sized organization.

**1. Identify Organization and Issues**: Choose an organization experiencing operational issues that could be addressed by a new or improved database. Conduct research to understand the organization's operations, and obtain necessary permissions for data collection.
**2. Data Modeling**: Utilize Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) to model the database. Identify and resolve anomalies through normalization.
**3. Implementation**: Physically implement the database using Microsoft SQL Serverâ„¢. Write Transact SQL (T-SQL) statements to create database structures, populate tables with sample data, and define queries to address identified issues. Include stored procedures, triggers, and other programming objects to enhance usability.
**4. Security**: Enable mixed mode authentication, create user accounts, and ensure appropriate permissions are set.
**5. Scripting and Backup**: Group all code into a single script for easy execution. Create backups of the database.
**6. Additional Considerations**: Earn additional marks through adherence to coding standards, comments, naming conventions, exception handling, readability, and code efficiency.

This guideline provides a framework for demonstrating knowledge and skills in designing, implementing, and manipulating relational databases to address organizational needs.
